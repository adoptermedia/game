VERCEL DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS
========================

When deploying on Vercel, use these settings:

1. IMPORT PROJECT
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Import the project

2. CONFIGURE PROJECT (Vercel will auto-detect from vercel.json)
   Framework Preset: Other
   Root Directory: ./
   Build Command: npm run dist && cp index.html dist/ && cp -r games dist/
   Output Directory: dist
   Install Command: npm install

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   - None required

4. BUILD & DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS
   Node.js Version: 18.x (recommended)
   
PROJECT STRUCTURE:
/
├── src/            (Phaser source code)
├── dist/           (Built files - this becomes the public root)
│   ├── index.html  (Landing page)
│   ├── phaser.min.js
│   └── games/
│       ├── demo-platformer/
│       └── tic-tac-toe/
├── games/          (Game source files)
├── package.json
└── vercel.json     (Deployment configuration)

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Build command runs `npm run dist` to compile Phaser to dist/
2. Then copies index.html and games/ folder into dist/
3. Vercel serves everything from dist/ as the public root
4. All paths are relative to dist/ (e.g., /phaser.min.js, /games/tic-tac-toe/)

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect settings from vercel.json
6. Click "Deploy"

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If deployment fails, check build logs
- Ensure all file paths use absolute paths (starting with /)
- The dist folder is the public root - all URLs are relative to it
