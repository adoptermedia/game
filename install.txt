VERCEL DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS
========================

When deploying on Vercel, use these settings:

1. IMPORT PROJECT
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Import the project

2. CONFIGURE PROJECT
   Framework Preset: Other
   Root Directory: ./
   Build Command: npm run dist && cp index.html dist/ && cp -r games dist/
   Output Directory: dist
   Install Command: npm install

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
   - None required for basic deployment

4. BUILD & DEPLOYMENT SETTINGS
   Node.js Version: 18.x (or latest LTS)
   
5. FUNCTIONS (Optional)
   - Not required for this static game site

NOTES:
- The vercel.json file in the project root will override these settings
- The build command compiles Phaser and copies all game files to dist/
- Games are served from /games/[game-name]/ paths
- The landing page is served from the root /

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to vercel.com
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Use the settings above (or rely on vercel.json auto-detection)
6. Click "Deploy"

The deployment will automatically use the vercel.json configuration file.
